I am interested in learning about science and social justice. My fvorite podcast is called Ologies by Alie Ward and it feateres a new scientist every week that talks 
about ther research. It is amazing!

I am currently working on Social Justice initiatives in the Collegiate Panhellenic Community. 

My favorite hobby is spending time outside.
